Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.

## Quantifying the Hidden Costs of ProtectionIt's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.

Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

The **PPE Performance Impact Analyzer** is a research platform designed to systematically evaluate how personal protective equipment affects human performance, muscle fatigue, and occupational safety. This project addresses the critical balance between protection and performance in high-risk occupations.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

### The Protection-Performance Paradox

    ---

Personal protective equipment saves lives, but it also imposes physiological and biomechanical costs that can affect:    layout: page

    title: project

- **Muscle fatigue patterns**: Altered loading and earlier onset of fatigue    description: a project with a background image

- **Movement efficiency**: Restricted range of motion and compensatory strategies      img: /assets/img/12.jpg

- **Cognitive performance**: Attention and decision-making under protective constraints    ---

- **Heat stress**: Thermal burden and cardiovascular impact

- **Communication**: Impaired verbal and non-verbal interaction<div class="row">

### Research Focus Areas        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>

**Radiation Protective Equipment**: Comprehensive study of lead aprons and protective garments used in medical imaging, revealing significant impacts on:    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

- Lower back muscle activation (35% increase)        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

- Postural stability and movement patterns    </div>

- Fatigue onset timing (23% earlier)</div>

- Compensatory movement strategies<div class="caption">

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

**Respiratory Protection**: Analysis of mask and respirator effects on:</div>

- Work of breathing and cardiovascular load

- Communication effectivenessThe code is simple.

- Cognitive performance under breathing resistanceJust wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).

- Long-term comfort and complianceTo make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.

Here's the code for the last row of images above:

### Key Research Findings

**Muscle Activation Changes**:

- Erector spinae: 35% higher activation with radiation protection```html

- Trapezius: 28% increased sustained activity<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">

- Compensation patterns persist after PPE removal  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">

**Performance Degradation**:  </div>

- Fine motor control decreases with protective gloves  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">

- Visual field restrictions affect situational awareness    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

- Communication effectiveness reduced by 40% with full face protection  </div>

### Clinical Impact```



This research directly supports:{% endraw %}

- Safer healthcare environments through evidence-based PPE selection
- Improved first responder performance under protection
- Reduced musculoskeletal injuries in protected workers
- Enhanced compliance through more comfortable protective solutions

The **PPE Performance Impact Analyzer** represents a systematic approach to optimizing the protection-performance equation, ensuring that the equipment designed to keep workers safe doesn't create new risks through fatigue, impaired performance, or reduced effectiveness.
