<!-- Welcome to the news stream. Short inline notes highlight quick updates (acceptances, talks scheduled, resources released). Longer items appear as full posts for conference recaps, publication summaries, or reflective pieces.


How this works:
- Items with `inline: true` are rendered as concise line announcements.
- Items with `inline: false` behave like full posts and can include sections, figures, and references.
- All entries live under the `_news` directory; dates control ordering.

Subscribe / follow:
- RSS: Use the site feed to follow updates in your reader.
- Social: Key highlights may also appear on LinkedIn or Google Scholar profile updates.
