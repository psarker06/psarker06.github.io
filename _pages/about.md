Welcome! I'm **Dr. Pramiti Sarker**, an Assistant Professor passionate about creating healthier, more productive workplaces through the science of ergonomics. 

## 🎯 What I Do

My research focuses on **occupational ergonomics**—the art and science of optimizing human performance while protecting workers from injury. I specialize in:

- **🧠 Cognitive & Physical Workload Assessment**: Understanding how work demands affect both mind and body
- **⚡ Human Performance Optimization**: Enhancing productivity while maintaining well-being
- **🛡️ Injury Prevention**: Reducing neuromusculoskeletal disorder risks through evidence-based interventions
- **🔧 Ergonomic Solutions**: Designing practical workplace improvements that make a real difference

> *"Good ergonomics isn't just about preventing injury—it's about creating sustainable careers where people can thrive."*

## 🌟 Research Impact

I develop **multi-modal assessment methods** that capture the full picture of workplace demands, then translate these insights into actionable ergonomic solutions. My work bridges the gap between laboratory research and real-world implementation, ensuring that scientific advances actually improve people's working lives.
