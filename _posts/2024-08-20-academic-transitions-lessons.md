Academic careers are built on transitions—from student to researcher, from one institution to another, from mentee to mentor. Having recently joined West Virginia University after completing my PhD at Iowa State and serving as a visiting professor at Purdue, I've been reflecting on what makes these transitions successful and meaningful.

## The Geography of Research Impact

Moving from Iowa State's **Physical Ergonomics and Biomechanics Lab** to establishing my research program at WVU has taught me that **good science transcends location**, but **local context shapes application**.

### What Travels Well:
- **Methodological rigor** (EMG protocols, statistical approaches)
- **Collaborative relationships** (maintained connections with Mayo Clinic, previous mentors)
- **Research questions** (worker safety is universal)
- **Technical expertise** (biomechanical assessment skills)

### What Requires Adaptation:
- **Industry partnerships** (different regional manufacturing base)
- **Student backgrounds** (varying preparedness levels)
- **Institutional culture** (funding patterns, collaboration styles)
- **Community needs** (local workplace safety challenges)

## Building Bridges, Not Burning Them

One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is that **academic transitions work best when they're additive, not subtractive**. Rather than completely leaving behind previous connections, I've focused on:

### **Maintaining Research Collaborations**
- Continuing joint projects with **Gary Mirka's lab** at Iowa State
- Sustaining clinical research partnerships with **Mayo Clinic**
- Co-authoring papers with **Purdue colleagues**
- Sharing resources and expertise across institutions

### **Creating New Synergies**
- Identifying WVU faculty with complementary expertise
- Exploring regional industry partnerships
- Connecting with local healthcare systems
- Building relationships with undergraduate research programs

## The Mentoring Transition

Perhaps the biggest shift has been moving from **being mentored** to **becoming a mentor**. This transition requires developing entirely new skill sets:

### **What I'm Learning About Mentoring:**

**Listen More, Direct Less**: Students often know what they need better than we think they do.

**Celebrate Small Wins**: Research progress happens in increments, not breakthroughs.

**Model Work-Life Integration**: Sustainable research careers require sustainable practices.

**Embrace Different Learning Styles**: Not everyone processes information the way I do.

**Create Psychological Safety**: The best research happens when people aren't afraid to fail.

## Building Inclusive Lab Culture

Coming from a background in **international engineering education** (my early career at BUET in Bangladesh), I'm passionate about creating lab environments where diverse perspectives thrive.

### **Practical Strategies I'm Implementing:**

**Explicit Inclusion Practices**: 
- Clear communication about lab expectations
- Multiple ways to contribute to research projects
- Regular check-ins about research progress and personal well-being

**Skill Development Focus**:
- Technical training paired with professional development
- Conference presentation opportunities for all lab members
- Writing support and feedback systems

**Knowledge Sharing**:
- Lab meetings that highlight different expertise areas
- Cross-training on equipment and methods
- Collaborative problem-solving approaches

## The Research Continuity Challenge

Maintaining research momentum during institutional transitions requires strategic planning:

### **What Worked for Me:**

**Portable Projects**: Focusing on research questions that don't require institution-specific equipment or partnerships.

**Data Management**: Ensuring clean, well-documented datasets that could travel with me.

**Publication Pipeline**: Maintaining active manuscripts at various stages of the review process.

**Funding Strategy**: Applying for grants that support research infrastructure building at the new institution.

## Lessons for Early-Career Academics

If you're navigating similar transitions, here's what I wish I'd known earlier:

### **Before the Move:**
- **Document everything**: Protocols, data management systems, analysis pipelines
- **Communicate openly**: Keep collaborators informed about timeline and plans
- **Plan overlap periods**: If possible, maintain some connection to previous institution during transition

### **During the Transition:**
- **Be patient with yourself**: Research productivity will temporarily dip
- **Invest in relationships**: Spend time getting to know new colleagues
- **Stay connected**: Maintain previous collaborations while building new ones

### **After Settling In:**
- **Evaluate and adapt**: What worked at the previous institution may need modification
- **Seek feedback**: Ask students and colleagues about lab culture and communication
- **Plan for sustainability**: Build systems that will outlast your individual presence

## The West Virginia Opportunity

What excites me most about joining WVU is the opportunity to address **regional workforce challenges** while contributing to **global ergonomics knowledge**. West Virginia's industrial heritage and ongoing economic transitions create unique opportunities for applied ergonomics research.

I'm particularly interested in:
- **Healthcare worker safety** in rural settings
- **Manufacturing ergonomics** in evolving industrial contexts  
- **Student development** in underrepresented engineering populations
- **Community engagement** around workplace wellness

## Looking Forward

Academic transitions aren't just about changing institutions—they're about **growing as researchers, mentors, and community members**. Each move brings new perspectives, challenges assumptions, and creates opportunities for impact.

The goal isn't to replicate what worked elsewhere, but to **build on that foundation** while **adapting to new contexts and opportunities**.
