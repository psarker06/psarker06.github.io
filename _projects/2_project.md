## Precision Tools for Muscle Fatigue Research

The **EMG Fatigue Analyzer** is a comprehensive software toolkit designed to extract meaningful fatigue metrics from electromyography (EMG) signals. This project addresses critical gaps in EMG analysis standardization and provides researchers with validated, reproducible methods for fatigue assessment.

### The Research Problem

EMG fatigue analysis suffers from inconsistent methodologies, with studies using different sampling parameters, analysis windows, and fatigue metrics. This variability makes cross-study comparisons difficult and limits the clinical translation of research findings.
