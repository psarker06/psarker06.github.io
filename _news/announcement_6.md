Excited to announce the launch of our new research initiative combining artificial intelligence with traditional ergonomic assessment methods.

---

## Project Overview

This collaborative project brings together expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and human factors engineering to develop next-generation workplace assessment tools.

### Research Objectives

**Real-time Posture Analysis**: Developing computer vision algorithms that can analyze worker postures from standard workplace cameras, eliminating the need for specialized motion capture equipment.

**Predictive Fatigue Modeling**: Creating AI models that can predict fatigue onset based on movement patterns, task characteristics, and individual worker profiles.

**Automated Risk Assessment**: Building intelligent systems that can identify ergonomic risk factors and provide immediate feedback to workers and supervisors.

### Industry Partnerships

We're collaborating with:
- **Healthcare Systems**: Implementing AI monitoring in surgical environments
- **Manufacturing Companies**: Deploying smart assessment tools on production lines  
- **Technology Firms**: Developing wearable sensor integration and data analytics platforms

### Expected Impact

This initiative aims to:
- Make ergonomic assessment more accessible to small and medium enterprises
- Provide continuous monitoring capabilities rather than point-in-time evaluations
- Enable personalized recommendations based on individual worker characteristics
- Reduce the cost and complexity of workplace health programs

### Timeline

- **Phase 1** (2024): Algorithm development and laboratory validation
- **Phase 2** (2025): Pilot testing in real workplace environments  
- **Phase 3** (2026): Commercial deployment and scaling

Stay tuned for updates as this exciting project develops!
